<ul><h3 style="color:brown">Millions of people have walked the earth and many will still do. However, no two people have the same characteristics even among identical twins. Personalities, regardless of how dissimilar, make the world full of varieties. This is why I know I am uniquely me and the best version of myself there is. Perfection is a mirage, however the best individuals are those give it their all in order to attain perfection while knowing that it is impossible to be perfect. I believe people should strive to improve their life and be the best they can ever be regardless of how impossible the task may be.</h3>

<p style="font-family:Adobe Hebrew;">My name is Norsarah Ayuni Binti Mohd Affandi and I am 20 years old. Most of my friend call me Sarah but my family call me Ayuni. I was born on 5th February 2000 in Temerloh Pahang and I grew up in Pahang until my age of 4. In 2005, my family has moved Kelantan and lived in Kelantan until now. I am the fourth in the family. I live in Pasir Tumboh, Kota Bharu. My Secondary School was SMK Long Gafar and after that I pursued my diploma at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM). This year, I am a final year student of diploma in Information Management. </p>

<p style="font-family:Adobe Hebrew;">I’m always looking for ways to develop my skills and learn new things not just in school but outside the school environment. I share ideas with my friends, we learn interesting things about one another, and most of the people I associate with I met with while on the lookout for ways to advance my skills.I have every intention to make the world a better place. I know I’m no superman and I have no concrete plans right now, but I am on a road to discovery.</p>
