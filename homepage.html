<p style="border:8px dashed rosybrown;">I love to solve problems wheather it's finding the most elegant to write a line a code or figuring out which chord fits best into a progression, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions. At the same time, I like to engage in teamwork. Teamwork is very important to make sure the collaboration with members  are in good condition and can achieve the objective. There are some important skill that I considered when build a teamwork which are organizing, decision making, problem solving and communication skill. All these skills should be taken into account so that teamwork can be carried out properly and help each other. Therefore, teamwork educates individuals to become  braver persons and have high leadership qualities.</p>
