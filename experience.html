<h1 style="color:olive;">My Experience</h1>
<hr>

<ul><p style="font-family:Adobe Hebrew;">My experience as a UiTM student in Machang, Kelantan, I joined a club known as Intellectual Members of Muslim Nation (IMAN). The club is the only club established at UiTM Machang which has da'wah and Islamic elements.</p></ul>

<ul><p style="font-family:Adobe hebrew;">Throughout my time as one of the committee members in this club a variety of experience and knowledge I have acquired such as skills in organised, communication skills, teamwork, time management and so forth can enhance the knowledge in religious field as there are various partnerships from programmes and activities implemented in Islamic studies.Among the programmes and activities that the club has implemented are:</p></ul>

<ol>
	<li><h2 style="color:brown">Team Building</li></h2>

    <p style="font-family:Adobe Hebrew;">The programme was implemented for three days located at Bachok Kelantan. The purpose of this programme is to enhance the knowledge of members of the Intellectual Members of Muslim Nation (IMAN) club in managing the club smoothly and strengthening relationships with each other.</p>

    <img src="image7.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">
    <p style="font-family:Adobe Hebrew;">The program is collaborating with the president of the Intellectual Members of Muslim Nation (IMAN) club from UiTM Kota Bharu who was invited as a panel in the program that speaks of the title 'Favors or Disasters.'</p>
</ol>

<ul><p style="font-family:Adobe Hebrew;">These are among the programmes and activities carried out throughout 2019 before online Distance Learning (ODL). I hope the club continues to succeed and implement programmes and activities that can have a more positive impact than ever before by new leaders in the next semester.
